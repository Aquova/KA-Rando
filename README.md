-- Overview --
A program that will randomize the abilities that Kirby will gain from eating enemies in Kirby's Adventure.
Ex. When eating a fire enemy, instead of gaining the fire ability, Kirby will gain a random ability.

-- Usage --
Currently the program is simply a lua script to be used with FCEUX (or the lua-compatible emulator of your choice). Designed to be run with a US ROM of Kirby's Adventure for NES.

Later updates to include a program to modify a ROM to be used with any emulator.
