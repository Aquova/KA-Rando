# Kirby's Adventure Hacking Notes

Kirby's Adventure is a very old game, and people have been attempting to hack it for years. However, unlike some games, there doesn't seem to be any centrally located source of information collected over the years, instead the information is scattered throughout several different wikis, personal websites, and defunct forums. All of the notes in the 'Archived Notes' directory are *not* written by me, but simply gathered by myself in a central location. There all appear as originally written, poor grammar and weird internet jokes included.
