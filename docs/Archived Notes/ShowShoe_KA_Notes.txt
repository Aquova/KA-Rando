This thread has been moved from another forum to keep it from being removed, the documentation is sloppy and unprofessional, but it's for my personal use, I just want to share it if anyone gets this crap. And no, I didn't spice it up with html tags or autolinked URLs. This is for contribution/looks only, unless you want to comment really bad, in that case it's a normal thread.

Well I kinda broke the editor when I compiled it, so all I have is text editing, graphic editing, palette editing, and sprite tweaks. I've made text tables, too. Fortunately it's farther than any other Kirby hack out there. DANG JAPZ AND THEIR ASM!?!@ Ever since I moved I got bored of this, but you wanted to see it. Please don't complain about when Kirby floats he looks ugly, or some palette errors, it's in beta.

Screenies:

File Selection

Title Screen

Quick Draw (don't complain about me using patchiblock or any characters related to me, its my hack. :P)

Yogurt Yard

Butter Building

Space Pause Screen!

Parasol - the name of this hack

Header mod - new music and palette

Parasol - again

Kirbo - He makes you hyper!

Welcome
======

This was supposed to be a list of things and addresses so I wouldn't
forget them. It turned out to be this. No credit required if used of
course.

BG and FG Palettes
=============

NOTE FOR BGFG AND SPRITE PALETTE SECTIONS: You can find more palettes by finding the palette values in a PPU editor and searching for them in a palette editor.

Various BG and FG palettes are located at the beginning of the ROM
when viewed in a palette editor. (10)

For example,

Clouds: 210
Ground: 710

Sprite Palettes
===========

NOTE: I stumbled upon some palettes at 69D20, I don't know what
they are used for but they look like sprite palettes to my knowledge.

Sprite palettes are located in 24E65 - 24F90. (6 bytes each - 2
sets of 3 colors) They are possibly located in the note above.

Starting from 24E65 with commentary (with no constantly repeated palettes.):

Light Peach - Peach (In between all of the colors listed below.)
White - Gold
White - Green
White - Gold
White - Blue
White - Ice (Ice Brr!)
Dark Castle Room Palette? (Black - Dark Bluish Purple)
Dark Castle Room Palette? (Black - Dark Purple)
Light Peach - Gold (Weird)
Gray Colors (Nostalgia Level perhaps?)
White - Dark Peach
White - Purple
White - Light Green (Mint :D)
White - Darker Ice Color
White - Brownish Red (Copper?)
White - Darker Ice Color (Repeat...)
White - Gold (Another repeat...)
White - Solid Pink
White - Light Pink
White - Blue (has palette number 11)
White - Dark Gray
White - Dark Pinkish Red
White - Light Green (mint again)
White - Ice (moar ice)
White - Red
White - Blue
Light Gold - Gold
White - Pink
White - Gold (again)
White - Darkish Blue
Light Peach - Light Green (WTF?)
Light Peach - Darkish Purple (Moar WTF)
White - Red (repeat)
Red - Dark Red
White - Solid Blue?

Skipping weird colors ...

White - Light Gray ("Gray Colors")
White - Lightish Blue (palette 21)
White - Darkish Ice Blue (palette 22)
White - Lightish Purple
White - Light Solid Pink
White - Kirby's Pink Shade Color (not the light shade BTW)
White - Peach
White - Gold
White - Lightish Gold
White - Monster Green (light?)
White - Dark Monster Green
White - Light Green (MINT)
White - Darkish Cean
Dark Gold - Really Dark Gold
Darkish Gray - Dark Cean (commonly seen on Windows 95 desktop screens)
White - Light Green (ASDF MINT)
Light Gold - Orange
White - Kirby's Pink Shade Color (Still the dark shade)
Light Gold - Gold
White - Gray
White - Orange

Phew.. that was a lot...

(I would list the addresses, but you could see for yourself in a palette editor)

Enemy Level Data
============

NOTE: Could erase your game! Remember to backup files.

Just above this are all of the level's enemy data. Most have the value 11, while
some are different. Changing these give LOL effects. Most commonly, slowdown.

The starting address is 24A90.

For example,

First Room In Vegetable Valley 1: Change 24ABB's 11 to 12/any number. Lots of weird stuff
happens. I won't tell you, see for yourself!

Often a bunch of sprites fall out of nowhere and some are boss sprites, however,
collecting the Star Rod Piece doesn't do anything when you beat em'.

Text
===

NOTE: Requires table files for editing, sadly, I am the only one that has them, (probably) and
that's why it's so easy for me to find a bunch of text crap in FCEUXD's hex editor.

The how to draw lesson is located at 7A979. (At the beginning of the game where
it tells you how to draw Kirby)

ASCII "KIRBY" Easter Egg (Also seen in the RAM if you look. I also saw a ZELDA in there too?): 30852

I'm not telling you the rest yet, it's a secret! :>

Unknown
======

I have no clue what these are for:

18D00 - 18E00A
24000

I guess you could find out yourself, I got them from here:
http://zeldit.zophar.net/gamehacking/kirby.html

Various
=====

Lives: 307FD (Default 4)
Initial Health Per Game: 30802 (Default 2F or 4F)
UFO Being Able to Leave Levels: 2BC5F (default C9 - change to A5 for all-time use)
Energy Pep Drinks give you: 2D253 (default is 08)

RAM

Level Headers
==========


In case you didn't know level headers are apparently 8 bytes and are right before their room's data.
(which is confusing because the level data is compressed)

Format:
-------

1st byte= Level ID (number?)
2nd byte= Room length
3rd byte= Room depth/height
4th byte= Level tileset
5th byte= Level palette
6th byte= Enemy tileset
7th byte= Enemy palette
8th byte= BGM

For example,

1289D / Level 1-1:1 (value: 07)
1289E / Length of level 1-1:1 (04)
1289F / Depth/height of 1-1:1? (01)
128A0 / Tileset for 1-1:1? (07)
128A1 / 1-1:1 Palette (07)
128A2 / 1-1:1 Enemy tileset (9A)
128A3 / 1-1:1 Enemy palette (26)
128A4 / Music byte for 1-1:1 (00)

Misc Headers
--------------

0A379-0A380/ Level Finish header (for all levels)

Music
------

NOTE: If you have a 100% save file (can be found at Zophar), use Sound Test,
it has all of the music listed in hex!

I'll try to add more stuff later.

some more info

[13:34:59] <Snowshoe> I might do some more graphic stuff
[13:35:04] <Snowshoe> Also
[13:35:25] <Snowshoe> there is an address in the RAM that when you freeze it, it makes the music even more NES than the original
[13:35:26] <Snowshoe> as in
[13:35:33] <Snowshoe> Super Mario Bros. quality
[13:35:37] <+PercentN> cool
[13:36:12] <Snowshoe> but some songs (ice cream island, kirby dance, crane fever) have long, and usually annoying beeps at the end :[
[13:36:41] <Snowshoe> in the case of ice cream island its just a long beep
[13:37:11] <Snowshoe> because the developers left the sound byte as nothing, freezing one of the notes makes it sound annoying
[13:37:25] <Snowshoe> and you have to time it as well
[13:37:33] <Snowshoe> B0 and F0 are nothing :P

All of Kitoari's KA hacking videos- might prove to be useful if I can get some more info on what he did.

http://lotlot.net/nes/kirbyadv/maps/

This is an (old - actually as old as when I started this project) breakthrough for editing, as the above link includes:

Every level in the game, in hex, mapped with tiletypes.

Every tileset in the game, including unused ones.

Palettes

These can be used in an editor. I have everything I need, but I am too dumb to code it. So if you want to be a hero and code one, it's right there.
